# CG_1718

This repository holds the project of the curricular unit Computer Graphics (CG).

The goal of this assignment is to develop a mini scene graph based 3D engine and provide usage examples that show its potential.

The assignment is split in four phases:
- Phase 1: Graphical Primitives
- Phase 2: Geometric Transforms
- Phase 3: Curves, Cubic Surfaces and VBOs
- Phase 4: Normals and Texture Coordinates

At the end we got a fairly complete system. As an example of use one has the representation of a solar system, where we can surf throughout the space \o/
